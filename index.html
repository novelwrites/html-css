    <h2>About Nancy Golden:</h2>
 <p>I wear lots of different hats – I am a wife and mom, I am an engineer, I am a small business owner, I am a teacher and I am an author. I am also the director of the Carrollton League of Writers. I have a passion for learning about people and cultures from around the world and we often host international students in our home. Currently, I am a student in the <span>TEKsystems</span> full stack software developer bootcamp. I have been a Trekkie for as long as I can remember. I am a follower of Jesus Christ. This list is by no means exhaustive but in everything I do, I strive to follow what Paul wrote in Philippians 4:8, “Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things.”</p>
